# A simple app for calculations

There are a number of calculations I have to do at my dayjob that can be somewhat annoying to have to whip out the calculator for. So, I built a simple app that will automatically clauclate these for me. Cool thing is that it automatically will not allow the entry of non-numerical inputs and the result updates automatically using useEffect.
